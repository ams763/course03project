##Study Design

The script run_analysis.R is used to get, format, and process data from a study carried out at the Universit√† degli Studi di Genova in which smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data were collected from 30 subjects while they performed 6 different activities. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, and a data set was produced for each group. Each data set contains thousands of observations of 561 variables which abstract mathematical features from the raw sensor output over short time slices. Each observation corresponds to a 2.56 s time slice of sensor output. More information on the study can be found in the README.txt file of the study data, available as a [zip file](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

The script contains a function `analyze_data`, called without arguments, which processes the downloaded study data into two R data frames and outputs these as elements of a list of length 2. The data frames are a data set and a summary table.

The data set's ID variables are study subject and activity, and its measure variables are a subset of the study's 561 variables, namely the 66 variables that take either the mean or the standard deviation of some measurement observed over a time slice. The data set contains all observations from both of the study data sets, 10,299 in total. See below for list and descriptions of variables.

The summary table collapses all observations for each subject-activity pair into a single observation, whose measure variables contain means of the corresponding measure variables taken over all observations of the subject-activity pair. The result is a data frame of 180 observations, i.e. one for each possible subject-activity pair. For example, if Subject 12 was observed walking in 53 different time slices, the summary table will contain a single row with subjectid = 12 and activity = walking, and the value of tBodyAccMeanX in this row will be the mean of 53 different observations of tBodyAccMeanX in the data set.

The steps performed by `analyze_data` are as follows:

1. Generate an ordered list of the 6 activities.
2. Generate an ordered list of the 561 mathematical feature names, formatted for use in data frames. 
3. Generate an index vector to select only mean and standard deviation features. 
4. Convert the study's "test" data set to an R data frame. 
  1. Convert the text file containing observed data to an R matrix. 
  2. Convert the matrix to a data frame and label with feature names. 
  3. Select only the mean and standard deviation feature variables. 
  4. Append ID variables for activity and subject to the data frame. 
5. Convert the study's "train" data set to an R data frame in the same manner.
6. Merge the data frames from steps 4 and 5. The train/test distinction will be lost.
7. Generate a summary table for the data frame from step 6.

###Remarks

Variable names for the data set and the summary table are identical.
 
The general formula for the retained mathematical feature names has six components selected from:

Component                  | Abbreviation
-------------------------- | ---------------------         
Time or Frequency          | t, f
Body or Gravity            | Body, Grav
Accelerometer or Gyroscope | Acc, Gyr
Jerk                       | NULL, Jerk
Mean or Standard Deviation | Mean, Std
Dimension or Magnitude     | NULL, X, Y, Z, Mag

* "Frequency" refers to features obtained by a Fast Fourier Transform on the corresponding "time" feature.
* "Body" and "Gravity" refer to mathematically separated components of accelerometer measurements.
* "Jerk" refers to features obtained by differentiation with respect to time.
* "Magnitude" is the Euclidean norm of the X, Y, and Z measurements for the named feature. "Mag" appears earlier in the name than dimension labels.
